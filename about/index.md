## Introduction

I am a third year Communications Systems bachelor's student at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). I am currently doing a one year exchange program at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
Otherwise, I am passionate by Mathematics and Computer Science.
I like developing mobile applications, especially for Android. Also, I am interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. I am finally interested decentralised systems, user privacy, and blockchain.
